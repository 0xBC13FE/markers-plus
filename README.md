![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/attackbyfire.png) | Attack by Fire | It's when a commander uses both direct and indirect firepower to mess with the enemy, like shooting at them from a distance, without necessarily having to get up close and personal to wipe them out, keep them busy, or trick them.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/block.png) | Block | It's when we block the enemy from getting into a certain spot or stop them from moving in a specific direction or path.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/breach.png) | Breach | It's when the unit goes all out to smash through or find a way past an enemy defense, obstacle, minefield, or fortress, using everything they've got.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/bypass.png) | Bypass | It's when the commander tells the unit to find a way around something, like an obstacle, enemy, or tricky situation, so they can keep going with their mission without getting into a fight.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/canalize.png) | Canalize | It's when the commander uses the lay of the land, along with things like obstacles, firepower, or our own maneuvers, to squeeze the enemy into a tight spot, so they can't move around much.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/ccppoint.png) | Casualty Collection Point | A location that may or may not be staffed, where casualties are assembled for evacuation to a medical treatment facility.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/checkpoint.png) | Checkpoint | A predetermined point on the ground used to control movement, tactical maneuver, and orientation. Also called CP.

![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/clear.png) | Clear | It's when the commander's job is to kick out all the enemy forces and wipe out any organized resistance in a specific area.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/contain.png) | Contain | It's when the commander needs to either make the enemy stay put, surround them, or make them focus on one front so they can't pull their troops away for some other job.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/cordonknock.png) | Cordon and Knock | In a cordon and knock operation, counterinsurgency forces basically gather around a spot to keep it safe (cordon), and then they ask the folks who live there if it's okay to have a look around (knock).
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/cordonsearch.png) | Cordon and Search | It's a way of approaching an area where you think there might be bad guys or illegal stuff. First, you close off the area to trap them, and then you search places you suspect to find and capture or destroy any enemy fighters and illegal goods.
![](https://github.com/0xBC13FE/ImageDatabase/blob/main/PNG/cover.png) | Cover | It's like a security move to shield the main group from the bad guys. We send a team out to keep the enemy from spotting us and shooting at the main group while buying us some extra time.
